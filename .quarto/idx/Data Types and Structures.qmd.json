For the purposes of our course, we are going to be working mostly with data frames. A data frame is a tabular data structure with observations in the rows and variables in the columns. Each of these variables might be stored within the data frame as different levels of data. There are a few tricks in R to identify and change the level of data.\n\nFollow each chunk to examine the a data set.\n\n```{r}\nhyb <- read.csv(file.choose()) # choose hybrid.csv}\n```\n\nFirst, you can take a look at the data set using a few different functions. Follow the logic in the next chunk to inspect the data.\n\n```{r}\nhyb # call the object you created to see the whole data set.  \nhead(hyb, 5) # Take a look at the first 5 observations in the set (you can set the number) \n\ntail(hyb, 10) # Look at the last 10 observations (you can set the number)\n```\n\nSo, we have quite a few numeric and categorical variables here. We need to know how each of these variables are stored in this data set so we know how to work with them. The following chunk uses the str() function to take a look at how this data set is structured.\n\n```{r}\nstr(hyb)\n```\n\nStarting from the top right, we have a data.frame (a type of data structure) that has 154 observations (the rows) with 9 variables (columns). under this line is an explanation of each of the 9 variables. From left to right, we have the name of the variable, the type, then a short example of the data stored therein. For example, we have an 'id variable' stored as an integer (int) which. The \"model\" variable is stored as a character (chr) variable which indicates that it is stored as text (also known as a string). There is one more variable class you should know which is factor. While characters are text, factors are categories with a set number of possible values.\n\nNotice the \\$? The \\$ is an operator used in R to access different elements in an object. This comes in handy when we want to work with the data and transform it. For example, we may wish to view certain elements of this data frame. Follow the logic in the following chunk.\n\n```{r}\nclass(hyb$id) # identify the class of data using class()\n\nhyb$id_chr <- as.character(hyb$id) # change a variable to a character create a new variable with that. \n\nclass(hyb$id_chr)\n```\n\nOne final thing to note when working with character data is that often you need to convert characters into factors so that R recognises the long list of text as being truly categorical. This actually encodes each unique character as a distinct category recognising all with the same text as sharing a category.\n\nFor example, the variable 'class' is actually categorical. What type of car it is. It is, however, stored as a character. In order to do anything with this variables (say visualising average cost by each category?), we need to convert this into a factor.\n\n```{r}\nhyb$class <- as.factor(hyb$class)\n\nclass(hyb$class)\n```\n\nKeep this trick in your pocket! You are likely going to need this throughout the semester!\n\n## Levels of Data\n\nWithin a data set you will encounter different variables that are measures at various levels and using different units of measurement. Let's say, for example, you have some survey data that asks questions about the respondent's biological sex, income, and how satisfied they are are work. All of these questions are useful, and can be useful in visualisation. However, there are some visualisations that are more appropriate and useful for some of these more than others. In order to properly visualise data, we need to understand data.\n\nThere are two main 'umbrella' terms that you can use when talking about data. These are, **categorical** and **numeric**. Categorical data, as the name suggests, are measured in buckets or categories while numeric data use units and numbers. There are a few further distinctions you need to understand before these become useful to you.\n\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Categorical Data                                                                                                                         |\n+==========================================================================================================================================+\n| Nominal: These are data with distinct labels that have no quantitative difference between one another.                                   |\n|                                                                                                                                          |\n| E.g.

So, you must decide what to do.
